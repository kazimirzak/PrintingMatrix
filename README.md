# PrintingMatrix
Pretty version of toString for 2D arrays. Originally designed for matrix printing

- Created this for an object in java that has an attribute called matrix which is a 2D array.
- Created for my students while working as TA, so they could focus on the tasks given instead of how to print a matrix.
